# Video-Games
My first ever video game
This game requires Unity to build and play. The game works with a keyboard and mouse.
The control scheme is as follows. WASD to move, the mouse to aim, and the number keys to equip your required spells in the hotbar
The user must press I to open up the inventory, and press ESC to open up the main game menu.
To equip spells, you have to press I first, the click on the item you wish to equip, and then press a number from 1 to 5 to equip the spell to your hotbar.
